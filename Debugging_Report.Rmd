## R Markdown

This report outlines the debugging process for the historical weather script that uses the Open-Meteo API to collect, visualize, and save weather data.

## Errors Encountered and Fixes

### 1. **Library Loading**
- **Error**: `libray(httr)` → Typo.
- **Fix**: Corrected to `library(httr)`.

### 2. **Incorrect Parameter Names**
- `temperture_unit` → corrected to `temperature_unit`
- `qury` in `GET()` → corrected to `query`

### 3. **Wrong API Response Handling**
- `response$status` is not a valid attribute.
- **Fix**: Replaced with `status_code(response)`.

### 4. **Incorrect Field References**
- `hourly$temp` → corrected to `hourly$temperature_2m`
- `formt` in `as.POSIXct()` → corrected to `format`

### 5. **Plotting**
- Plot lines tried to access `df$temp`, which doesn’t exist.
- **Fix**: Changed to match corrected column names.

## Additional Improvements
- Added `if (!require(...))` to auto-install packages if not already available.
- Added inline comments for clarity and to explain purpose to non-technical users.
- Used `str(hourly)` for column name validation.

## Outcome
The script now successfully downloads data, creates time series plots, and saves the data to a local RDS file. All major bugs and data parsing issues have been addressed.
